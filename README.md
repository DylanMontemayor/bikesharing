# bikesharing
##Overview of the Module 14 Challenge

Bike usage has increased during the last years because of the increase in awareness about the environment and the advantage of doing some exercise while getting around. The next report shows the behavior of a bike-sharing program that demonstrates the viability of duplicating their model to Des Moines.

## Results

Through the next visualizations, data will demonstrate the feasibility of the project and certain considerations for maintaining and managing the actual resources. 

### Top starting location

This visualization shows locations where users usually pick a bike to start their trip. The color and size of the circles are directly related to the number of bikes that start in those coordinates. This information is needed to ensure there are enough bikes in the right location at the right time.

### Top ending location

This map shows the specific locations where clients and subscribers usually drop the bike. As with the previous image, the color and size of the circles are directly related to the number of bikes. This information is key for the maintenance team since they need to pick up the bike where they were dropped off.

### Trip Duration

This chart represents the number of bikes per how at different minutes of each hour. We noticed that from 0 to 2 AM are the best hours to perform the maintenance because there is a low number of active users. Since there are no trips being done, the actual trip duration is cero.

### Trip Duration per Gender

This chart is pretty similar to the previous one, the difference is that we split the total number of bikes at a certain hour per gender. We can notice with the color distinctions and the references that there are more male users riding at those hours. We are starting to understand hour customers.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

This visualization represents the peak hours and days during the week. On weekdays, more people ride from 6AM to 9AM and from 5PM to 8PM. This probably makes sense with the horking and school hours. If people from the new city have similar schedules, we can consider this information for the new model.

### Trips per Gender

This visualization is like the previous one with the gender factor included. It can be inferred that certain genders prefer more to ride than others even when both of them use the bike at similar hours.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

As we already saw in the previous image, there are more male suscribers than any other gender. A new project for acquiring new subscribers could focus on understanding the main reasons for certain people to choose other transport This might include working to make the roads more accessible and secure.

## Summary

These visualizations demonstrate the feasibility of the project. Additionally, they show the importance of considering locations, days, and hours for scheduling maintenance operations within the company team. Finally, we can use some data to start new projects that can lead to new customers in the future.
